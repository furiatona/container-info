# Observability Stack

Using Cloud Monitoring with Managed Prometheus https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus. If you prefer to free one, use tobs https://github.com/timescale/tobs, But it's require minimal 2GB RAM, which is not suitable from k8s cost friendly version

Common important alert is UPTIME for public endpoint, we'll create one to expose our service in k8s using nodeport, readines probe for health check and ingress global IP

- Reserve IP
```
gcloud compute addresses create work-trial-ip --global --project work-trial-346603
gcloud compute addresses describe work-trial-ip --global --project work-trial-346603
```

- Create the ingress
```cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-container-info-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: work-trial-ip
  labels:
    app: container-info
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    service:
      name: test-container-info-service
      port:
        number: 8080
EOF
```
- Wait couple minutes to propagate and show the IP
